"Bluetooth Robot Car" is a GitHub repository that contains the code and instructions for building a robot car that can be controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth. The car is built using a microcontroller (such as an Arduino) and various electronic components, including motors and sensors. The repository likely includes the necessary wiring diagrams and code snippets for connecting the components and making the car move. Users can use a Bluetooth-enabled device, such as a smartphone or computer, to send commands to the car and control its movement. The repository may also include documentation on how to customize and expand upon the basic design to create a more advanced robot car.
